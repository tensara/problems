Perform the Tanh activation function on an input matrix:
$$
C[i][j] = \text{tanh}(A[i][j])
$$

The Tanh function is defined as:
$$
\text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}
$$

## Input:
- Matrix $A$ of size $M \times N$ containing floating-point values

## Output:
- Matrix $C$ of size $M \times N$ containing the Tanh activation values

## Notes:
- Both matrices $\text{A}$ and $\text{C}$ are stored in row-major order
