Perform multiplication of two symmetric matrices:
$$
C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A[i][k] \cdot B[k][j]
$$

## Input
- $A$ is a symmetric matrix of size $N \times N$
- $B$ is a symmetric matrix of size $N \times N$ 

## Output
- Matrix $C = AB$ of size $N \times N$

## Notes:
- All matrices $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$, and $\text{C}$ are stored in row-major order
