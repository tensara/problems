Perform matrix multiplication of two lower triangular matrices:
$$
C = A \cdot B
$$

Where A and B are lower triangular matrices.

The result C will also be a lower triangular matrix.

## Input
- Lower triangular matrix $A$ of size $N \times N$
- Lower triangular matrix $B$ of size $N \times N$

## Output
- Lower triangular matrix $C$ of size $N \times N$

## Notes:
- All matrices $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$, and $\text{C}$ are stored in row-major order.
- A matrix $L$ is lower triangular if $L_{ij} = 0$ for all $i < j$.
