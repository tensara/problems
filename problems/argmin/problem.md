Find the indices of minimum values along a specified dimension of an input tensor:
$$
\text{output}[i_1,\ldots,i_{d-1},i_{d+1},\ldots,i_n] = \arg\min_{i_d} \text{input}[i_1,\ldots,i_d,\ldots,i_n]
$$

where $d$ is the dimension to perform argmin over, $n$ is the number of dimensions.

## Input:
- Tensor `input` of arbitrary shape $S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots \times S_n$
- `dim` ($d$): Dimension to perform argmin over (0-based indexing)
- `shape`: Array containing the dimensions of the input tensor
- `ndim` ($n$): Number of dimensions in the input tensor

## Output:
- Tensor `output` with shape $S_1 \times \cdots \times S_{d-1} \times S_{d+1} \times \cdots \times S_n$
  - The output contains indices of minimum values along the specified dimension
  - The dimension being reduced is removed from the output shape

## Notes:
- The input tensor is stored in row-major order
- In case of ties (multiple minimum values), return the index of the first occurrence
- The output indices are 0-based
- The output tensor has one fewer dimension than the input tensor
