Compute the cumulative product (also known as prefix product or scan) of an input array:
$$
\text{output}[i] = \prod_{j=0}^{i} \text{input}[j]
$$

The cumulative product at each position is the product of all elements up to and including that position.

## Input:
- Vector $\text{input}$ of size $\text{N}$

## Output:
- Vector $\text{output}$ of size $\text{N}$ containing cumulative products

## Notes:
- The first element of the output is equal to the first element of the input
- Be careful about numerical stability with very large or very small numbers
