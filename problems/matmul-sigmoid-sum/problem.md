Perform a matrix multiplication followed by sigmoid activation followed by summation:

$$
\text{result} = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \sigma\left(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} A[i][k] \cdot B[k][j]\right)
$$

where $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is the sigmoid function.

This operation consists of three steps:
1. Matrix multiplication: $C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} A[i][k] \cdot B[k][j]$
2. Sigmoid activation: $S[i][j] = \sigma(C[i][j])$
3. Sum reduction: $\text{result} = \sum_{i,j} S[i][j]$

## Input
- Matrix $A$ of size $M \times K$
- Matrix $B$ of size $K \times N$

## Output
- Scalar value `output` representing the sum of $\sigma(AB)$

## Notes:
- The matrices $A$ and $B$ are stored in row-major order
